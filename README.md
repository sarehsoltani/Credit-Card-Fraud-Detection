## Case Study: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Anomaly Detection for Tabular Data

Fraud detection is a popular application of anomaly detection. Since the number of fraud cases is minimal compared to non-fraud cases, there is a need to use outlier detection. In this repo, we will go over a popular dataset known as the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset.

Here are some features of the dataset:


*   Contains 284k transactions in Europe of various amounts using their credit card
*   Each transaction is categorized into 2 classes: Fraud and non-fraud

* Features include amount per transaction. Most features have been anonymized due to confidentiality issues. Anonymization was done using Prinicpal Component Analysis.  

* There is a huge imbalance with the dataset, only 0.172% of cases are considered fraudulent.

* Need to deal with imbalance using correct metrics (i.e., no accuracy)
